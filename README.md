# regression_models
In this code I have implemented the linear regression and logistic regression models using R.
I have created a linear regression model using train set and the values have been predicted.
Also the actual values and the predicted values have been plotted to check the deviation between them. The logistic regression model is build using the employee salary column. 
And then let's predict the values using the test data. Finally a confusion matrix is created with a cut off value as 0.4.
